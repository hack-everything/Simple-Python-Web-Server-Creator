#Welcome to the "Web Server Creator" a simple project that creates a locally hosted web server. 

These instructions are for macOS, but there isn't much to using this script.
Open Finder, and the location you downloaded the "Web Server Creator" folder. 
Right click the folder, and select 'New Terminal Tab At Folder'
When the Terminal window opens, it should look something similar to this:

Type in ````Python ./web-server.py```` and hit enter! 
*If that doesn't work, try opening it in a python IDE like PyCharm.*

Once you hit 'Enter' you should be able to see it start "Creating" and "Generating" things,
it's total BS, if you remove the print and time.sleep commands you'd have one running in milliseconds 
It was just to make it look cool, and a way to make it seems like it is doing more 
than it actually is. 

Everything else, such as where to view the index.html/server.html, 
the script "generates" the links, but it just prints them. If you want them, make sure to say Yes/y 
when it asks.

I added a simple black background, with white text. It took like 15 seconds, and for what I remember no one uses
<style> [   ] </style> anymore, you do that in the style.css.
