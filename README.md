# Welcome to the "Web Server Creator" a simple project that creates a locally hosted web server. 

## This code is not a reflection of the code I write professionally, I just write shit code if its a small simple project. It's the simiplest way, and I did it in a few minutes

These instructions are for macOS, but there isn't much to using this script.
Open Finder, and the location you downloaded the "Web Server Creator" folder. 
Right click the folder, and select 'New Terminal Tab At Folder'
When the Terminal window opens, it should look something similar to this: 

![Terminal Example](https://doggo.ninja/jL4qha.png)

Type in ````Python ./web-server.py```` and hit enter! 
*If that doesn't work, try opening it in a Python IDE like PyCharm, and running it.*

Once you hit 'Enter' you should be able to see it start "Creating" and "Generating" things,
it's total BS, if you remove the print and time.sleep commands you'd have one running in milliseconds.
It was just to make it look cool, and a way to make it seems like it is doing more 
than it actually is. 

Everything else, such as where to view the index.html/server.html, 
the script "generates" the links, but it just prints them. If you want them, make sure to say yes/y 
when it asks.



# The funny shit
So now it sort of uses a style sheet? The server.html and index.html now look wayy better with a font, 
and other stuff! Still a black background, white text.


# Why?
Idk dude, people make weird things when they're ~~high~~ tired. I ask you: why not?
